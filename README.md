# Iris_classification_project# Iris Flower Classification

This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their measurements. The classification is achieved using various machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees.

## Overview

The Iris dataset contains:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width
- Species labels

The goal is to train a model to classify flowers based on the given features.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Training and testing of multiple machine learning models.
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy and classification report.
- Prediction for new input data.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
